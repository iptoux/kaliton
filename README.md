# kaliton
Kali Linux (rolling) Chrome OS chroot Environment 


## What is this?

Kaliton is based/forked on [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) and hard stripped/recoded to
only use an full featured Kali Linux (rolling) on your ChromeBook.

Because kaliton uses [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) as base, you will finde many elements
from it, many are removed and recoded.

## Can i test it?

Yes but, i had just done organize the structure and do some recode, 
but no tests/run yet.

## main/dev branch

On **dev** branch i do activly push test/beta commits, so please only
use the **main** branch for test/usage.
